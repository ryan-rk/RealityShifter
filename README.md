# Reality Shifter

This game was initially made for 2022 Brackeys Game Jam submission, which is then further polished into a minimum viable product. Join Grey's adventure as he overcome platforming obstacles and try to escape a strange world known as Reality Dimension. Using the newfound ability of Reality Shift, he will be able to shift the state of surrounding Reality Objects from Real to UnReal and vice versa.
